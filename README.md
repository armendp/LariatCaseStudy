**Capstone 1 Model**

Goal: the purpose of this model is to optimize metrics and inventory to maximize profit

Strategy 1: Boost branch performance by improving on key performance indicators
NOTE: For the purposes of this project, potential decrease in demand was not taken into account due to lack of information on price elasticity
    1A: Assume a 2% improvement on # of Trips & Avg Price per Day
    1B: Assume all branches hit 1626 # of Trips and $162 Avg Price per Day
    
Strategy 2: Remove unprofitable cars
    2A: Remove all 2018 unprofitable cars
    2B: Remove all unprofitable cars with a turnover rate of less than 7.1
